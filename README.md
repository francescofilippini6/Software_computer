The KM3NeT/ARCA detector is composed, in its final configuration of 230 strings deployed at a depth of 3500 m under the see level. In order to reduce the electronic components deployed at the botttom of the sea, all the data are sent on-shore and then processed from high level trigger algorithms (L1 and L2). Between these algorithms there is a muon reconstruction procedure based on a pre-fit of the photon hits impinging on a single detector string. The informations produced on different strings are then grouped together in an offline fit. A fast online algorithm is crucial for a neutrino telescope in order to produce allerts sent then to other observatories.  The main feature of this work is the training of the algorithm on a single string detector MonteCarlo files and the
