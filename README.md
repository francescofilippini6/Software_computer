Use and development of libraries implemented by KM3NeT collaboration for Machine Learning. Build of a CNN for discrimination between atmospheri muons (background) and neutrinos. Further informations:

The KM3NeT ARCA and ORCA detectors are composed, in their final configuration of 230 and 115 strings respectively deployed at a depth of 3500 m under the sea level. In order to reduce the electronic components deployed at the botttom of the sea, all the data are sent on-shore and then processed from high level trigger algorithms (L1 and L2). Between these algorithms there is a muon reconstruction procedure based on a pre-fit of the photon hits impinging on a single detector string. The informations produced on different strings are then grouped together in an offline fit. A fast online algorithm is crucial for a neutrino telescope in order to produce allerts sent then to other observatories for the multimessanger campaign. 
The main feature of this work is the training of a CNN with a single string detector MonteCarlo files and then compare its performances w.r.t. the usual algorithms applied for the muon reconstruction procedure. The progressive construction of these detectors will allows to keep also on the "algorithm-side" the modularity required in the construction phase. Another aspect to build this type of network is the possibility to apply it on the data originated at the BCI (Bologna Common Infrastructure) consisting in a unique 1 string test-bench able to implement in all the aspects the features and characteristic of the detector itself.
